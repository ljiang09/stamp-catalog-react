# Lily's Personal Stamp Collection Tool

This project digitizes my personal stamp collection. Stamp collections can
grow quite large and it can be hard to keep track of all the information
associated with each stamp. This digitized version helps manage everything.

## React Notes

This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run: `npm start`.

This runs the app in development mode in your browser. It should
automatically open a tab in your default browser, or you can manually open
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it.


## Dependencies

Material UI

npm install uuid
