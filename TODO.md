TODO:
make tooltip background opaque
add tags to each stamp, for easier filtering
create filtering capabilities based on tags
refactor data system to prevent repeat values in sets (set name, tags, date, etc)
create a custom and dynamic background w/ pure css or something crazy like that
connect to firebase

finish upload capabilities
add screen to update/edit stamps

replace "stampInfoDetailed" dataset with just a bunch of individual markdown files that are embedded within the page so you can add images and such

Make a split-flap display type thing where you can connect this app and it'll physically flip to the stamps you're viewing
