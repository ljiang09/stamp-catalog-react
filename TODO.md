TODO:
make tooltip background opaque
add tags to each stamp, for easier filtering
create filtering capabilities
create a custom and dynamic background w/ pure css or something crazy like that
make clicking on stamps navigate to a more in-depth info page? where the adhesion, country, etc. are listed

replace "stampInfoDetailed" dataset with just a bunch of individual markdown files that are embedded within the page
