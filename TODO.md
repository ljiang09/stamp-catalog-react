TODO: make tooltip background opaque create sort-by capability - note that you
can have both filtering and sorting at the same time create a custom and dynamic
background w/ pure css or something crazy like that

finish upload capabilities add settings screen to update/edit stamps

- also add button wihtin catalog tooltips to directly edit each stamp. Note that
  sets should be edited all together, so editing one will edit them all
- add space in upload to select tags, and post those to firebase
- shift upload inputs column left, have a second column to display what it'll
  look like in the catalog. Tooltip and everything.

Add accessibility aria into all components

replace "stampInfoDetailed" dataset with just a bunch of individual markdown
files that are embedded within the page so you can add images and such

Make a split-flap display type thing where you can connect this app and it'll
physically flip to the stamps you're viewing
