TODO:
make tooltip background opaque
create filtering capabilities based on tags
create sort-by capability - note that you can have both filtering and sorting at the same time
create a custom and dynamic background w/ pure css or something crazy like that
connect to firebase

finish upload capabilities
add screen to update/edit stamps

replace "stampInfoDetailed" dataset with just a bunch of individual markdown files that are embedded within the page so you can add images and such

Make a split-flap display type thing where you can connect this app and it'll physically flip to the stamps you're viewing
